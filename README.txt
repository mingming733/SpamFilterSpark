Windows might have problems unzipping this folder due to the naming scheme of tthe files, so if you do not see any files, try it on Linux, or use 7-zip instead of the default Windows unzip to unzip.

Big files (original data set, derived data) can be downloaded at:
http://students.engr.scu.edu/~vtai/files/enron/

The relevant files are all-mail.tar.xz (all of the Enron mails in one directory) and amail48k.tar.xz (48k random mails in one directory).
(use xz -d *.xz to uncompress)
